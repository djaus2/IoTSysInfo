# IoTSysInfo
A Universal Windows App that mimicks the web portal* to a Windows 10 IoT device. 

# Now Updated for new **OS Version:  10.0.14393.321 See Below 

## Platforms:
Windows 10 IoT, Windows 10 Desktop, Windows 10 Phone(Version 2 of app)

# About
A *Windows 10 IoT* device has a *web portal* in which you can view various aspects of the running device. You can also set some aspects. The readable status items are accessed via the portal gain this access through *REST* calls from *JavaScript*. This app uses the same APIs and accesses them through *REST*. As the responses are in *JSON* format, the app **recursively** parses the respone to generate the inormation to be displayed.

# UI Versions
There are two UI versions of this app, both using the same *REST* and *JSON* processing code. They differ on the UI interface in that the first version is a simple interface meant for a standard desktop screen. The second is more complex in that the UI is devided into three sections and are subject to *State Triggers*. This vesrion is meant for smaller screens as well as the desktop as the triggers can auotmatically hide parts of the UI which can be manually trigggered for display.
Repository Versions 2.0 are all of the second UI format. **See VERSIONs: below**

# The Take Home
This app shows you how you access various system attributes of a Windows 10 IoT device from a Universal Windows App running on the device or on another Windows 10 device (IoT, Phone or Desktop). It exemplifies REST calls and recursive JSON parsing.

# Acknowledgement
The basis of this app (wrt REST and the Web Portal API) came for a blog by Bruce Eitman:

### Footnote:
* The web portal of a Windows 10 IoT device is accessed at http://the_device_IP_address:8080
 
eg. http://192.168.0.28:8080

# VERSION: 7.0
* Updated for the Anniversary version of the OS, Build 14393
* On IoT-Core, Popups are not used for confirmation in favour of Yes Cancel Buttons (Middle pane at bottom)
* Need to set IOTCORE if Build Symbols for ARM builds
* Reboot/Restart etc now work when app runs on RPI2

#################################

# VERSION: 6.2
* Reboot/Restart now works.
* Checked Rename and new password. Both work.
* Added DateTime, Display resolution and Display Orientation. Display Resolution "works" but got to add code to decode it.
* Added Update but doesn't yet work.

# VERSION: 6.1
* Deployment of Package Installation files is now a separate function.
* Now installs on reboot
* Cleanup option as well

# VERSION: 6.0
* Revisted this after awhile!
* Now includes latest version of AppInstall toolkit from https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/tree/develop/Source-arm/Packages/Appx.Main/AppInstall
* When run remotely generates AppInstall toolkit customized for selected AppX package.
* Start by copying RemoteFileSystem textbox on app
* Choose AppxPackage and Cert files
* Copies these to target IoT-Core system, after you select (and create if needed) folder on target (you can paste copied RemoteFileSystem in FolderPicker)
* Will delete any existing files in that folder.
* Then select dependencies (These will be copied to same folder on target as appx and cert files)
* Then can run AppInstall from that folder via PowerShell or SSH
* Follow this on http://embedded101.com/Blogs/David-Jones
* [Yet to blog this update]

#################################

# VERSION: 3.0 
* A major rewrite of the UI codebehind. Now is a JSON file that list the commands and what URL to use. Can extend app simply now by added more command names and URLs

# VERSION: 3.2
* *startapp* now works: Drill into Packages and click on the Relative name of the app. It gets copied to the Params textbox. Then press startapp.
app command now fixed as well

# VERSION: 3.5
* *stopapp* now works AND *startapp* modified from Version 3.2:
* When you click on a specific package some of it's metadata gets copied to two textboxes in the Settings pane.
* When you then click on [startapp] or [stopapp] the required parameters are taken from these textboxes

# VERSION: 4.0
* **stopapp** now seeks confirmation and ForceStop option
* Added **shutdown** and **reset** system both with confirmation
* Added Confirmation Dialog for the above

# VERSION: 4.1
* Dialog boxes don't work on IoT, so in this version, the three commands that use them have Try-Catch around them, so are ignored.
* Relevant commands are stopapp, shutdown and reboot. Dialogs used for confirmation (and ForceStop option with stopapp)
* For stopapp there is a checkbox in the Settins to ForceStop if required.
* urls in the JSON file now have * at end if POST is to be used
* Package name is now "sensible" .. not a GUID. See Bruce's Blog.

# VERSION: 4.5
* Added **Uninstall** Package command

# VERSION 5.0
* Changes for **OS Version:  10.0.10531** Released 24th Sept 2015
* Two new commands implemented
* Set **Device Name**
* Set new **Administrator Password**
* There is a Checkbox that must be checked before those two commands work (for backward compatibility).
* Note: Two previous commands do not work now (ToDo) *Get Default App* and *SysInfo*

# VERSION 5.1
* Many of the "undocumented" URLs have changed from the previous version of the OS. There were some changes to some of the parameters. This version addresses this.
* There is now a Checkbox in the Configuration Pane that should be checked iff your are using the latest version of the OS **Version 10.0.10531**
* The JSON file hasn't been changed. There is conditional code that does the fixups.
* ToDo: Default_App doesn't work for the new OS.

# VERSION 5.2
* Default_App now works. Another changed URL

# VERSION 5.3
* Code improvement: There are now two versions of the commands and their URLs in **commands.json**.  
* **Commands**: The versions for the **RTM Build**
* **CommandsV2**: The versions for **OS Version:  10.0.10531**
* This removes the need to qualify the URLs eg:

                        //url changed between versions
                        if (SysInfo.IsOSVersuion10_0_10531)
                            cmd.url = "api/appx/packagemanager/package?package=*";


* When you select the OS Version Checkbox at the bottom of the Settings Pane, the commnds list is changed to the correct version.

# VERSION 5.4
* Code correction wrt the [api] command, which was broken. Fixed now.
* This command allows you to use any relative URL


# VERSION 5.5
* No new working functionality.
* Hopefully includes seeds for adding [packageInstall] command
* Its included but only to say its not there yet.
* Demonstrates UWA FilePicker to pick the package and its cert. [packageInstallSelect]
* Also uses it in [packageInstallAddDependency]
* And command [packageInstallState] get the state of install. This will return 200, but during an install returns 202
* Need to work out how the files get downloaded and actioned.
